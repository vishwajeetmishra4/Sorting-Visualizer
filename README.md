# Sorting Visualizer
# Introduction
Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based project designed to help users visualize different sorting algorithms through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This tool provides an engaging and educational experience, allowing users to observe the step-by-step process of various sorting algorithms.

# Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The project includes a user-friendly GUI that allows users to interact with and observe the sorting algorithms visually.

Sorting Algorithms: The visualizer supports a range of sorting algorithms, including:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

Real-Time Visualization: Watch sorting algorithms in action as the visualizer animates the sorting process in real-time.

Adjustable Speed: Users can control the speed of the sorting animation, enabling them to slow down or speed up the visualization to match their learning pace.

# Getting Started
1. Follow these steps to set up and run the Sorting Visualizer project:

2. Clone the Repository: Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
sh Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Vishwajeetmishra4/Sorting-Visualizer.git

3. Open the Project: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports Java to open the project.

4. Run the Application: Locate the main Java file (SortingVisualizer.java) and run the application. This will launch the Sorting Visualizer GUI.

# How to Use
1. Launch the application to open the Sorting Visualizer GUI.
2. Select a sorting algorithm from the available options (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort) using the dropdown menu.
3. Adjust the speed of the sorting animation using the provided speed control feature.
4. Click the "Visualize" button to start the sorting process. The visualizer will animate the selected algorithm, showing each step of the sorting process.
5. Observe the elements being sorted in real time on the graphical display.
6. Once the sorting is complete, experiment with other sorting algorithms or modify the input data to explore further.
